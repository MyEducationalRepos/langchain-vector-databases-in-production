      "The Life of Brian is a comedy film released in 1979, directed by Terry Jones and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. The movie is a satire on religion and tells the story of Brian Cohen, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as and next door to Jesus Christ and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah. The film was controversial upon its release due to its irreverent treatment of religious themes, but has since become a cult classic. It has a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is widely regarded as one of the funniest and most influential comedies of all time.\n"
